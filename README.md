# Location Fragment with Maps API Integration
This repository is created for the 2nd week assignment. The task is to create a Location Fragment using the Maps API. The tasks accomplished are as follows:

- Obtaining necessary permissions to use the map.
- Integrating Maps API and displaying the map on screen when the screen opens.
- Integrating Places API and marking the user's location on the map when the screen opens.
- Displaying the address of the marked location or the searched location next to the address text, by searching the location.
- In Figma design, there is no MyLocation button, but additionally, placing a marker on the user's location by clicking on the button next to the address text.
- Implementing the Balloon library to show tooltips in case the user does not notice the MyLocation button.
- Adding a ripple effect to the components on the screen.
- Designing UI for the necessary components and adding fonts.
